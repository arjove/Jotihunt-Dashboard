The Jotihunt Dashboard is a dashboard that is made for a local game called "Jotihunt". This game takes place in the second weekend of octobre each year. The game is all about sloving hints, collecting hunts and completing quests. As a sideline quest there also are photo quests. 

The history of the project:
Was origionally started for the Jotihunt 2015, But didnt get finished in time. Now we have moved the deadline to octobre 2016! in 2016 we plan to support a ton of devices, (including embedded devices.) and serve a great experience to score even higher!
